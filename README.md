#react-weather-charts

Retrieves weather data for a city or a coordinate from the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/) based on a user search or map click.

Uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management with [redux-promise](https://github.com/pburtchaell/redux-promise-middleware) and [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) middleware.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
